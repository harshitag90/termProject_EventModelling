Running Instructions for Cell DEVS with Cadmium Simulator:
As per the implementation for evacuation strategy, it is considered that there are pedestrians with 4 different cell states.
Therefore, different logic is applied for each cell state.
1. Change the paramters of Json configuration file and check the evacuation strategy for pedestrian with cell state 1 (Move upward first, and then to the left if there is a wall.)
2. Change the parameters of Json configuration file and check the evacuation strategy for pedestrian with cell state 2 (Move downward first, and then to the right if there is a wall.)

Refer the project report for more details.
